data: stores the data used to perform all 3 analyses

Air_Quality_Analysis.R: Performed time series analysis using fixed effects to see effects of pollution reduction 
  measures on air particulate matter. Found that pollution reduction measures also reduce the air particulate matter.

Farming_Analysis. R: Performed linear regression to see effects of a small business loan on farmersâ€™ wages, sales, 
  and number of employees. Found that small business loans increase all three metrics. 

Strategic_Blackouts_Analysis.R: Used an instrumental variable to determine effect of strategic blackouts on the number of 
  kW of solar PV on the grid. Found that another hour of blackouts decreases solar PV on the grid.
